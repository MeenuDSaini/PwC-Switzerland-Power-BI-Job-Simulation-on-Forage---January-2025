## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build a set of interactive and insightful dashboards that help the telecom industry client understand customer satisfaction, retention, and diversity performance better. The project is part of  PwC-Switzerland-Power-BI-Job-Simulation program, which helped me upskill in data analytics, KPI development, and Power BI visualization. I effectively communicated insights through clear visualizations, supporting data-driven decision-making and business strategy.

The repository contains Power BI files and insights reports for the following tasks:

**Task 1: Call Centre Performance Analysis Dashboard**

A Power BI dashboard visualising the Call Centre's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to customer satisfaction, calls, agent performance, and more. The dashboard includes:

Created a Power BI dashboard to analyze call centre performance, visualizing KPIs such as resolved vs unresolved cases, answered vs unanswered calls, monthly call trends, and call topics analysis. The dashboard includes key metrics like total calls, resolution rate, average speed of answered calls, and average customer satisfaction, enabling quick insights into agent performance and call handling efficiency.
Actionable Insights: The dashboard enabled easy monitoring of call centre performance, facilitating data-driven decision-making for operational improvements.

**Task 2: Customer Retention Dashboard**

A dashboard designed to help the telecom company understand customer retention better, with visual representations of at-risk customers and key retention metrics. KPIs include:

- Retention trends over time
- Customer churn analysis
- Early warning indicators for at-risk customers

**Task 3: Email Report - Retention KPIs**

A short email sent to the engagement partner with an explanation of the findings from the retention data analysis. This task also includes suggestions on how the retention strategy can be improved, along with a visualisation of relevant KPIs.

**Task 4: Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard**

This task focuses on analysing diversity and inclusion metrics at the telecom company, particularly regarding gender balance at the executive management level. The dashboard includes:

- Gender ratio in hiring, promotion, and turnover
- Performance ratings split by gender
- Key insights into slow progress and root causes
